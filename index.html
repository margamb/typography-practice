    <p><b>John Howard Carpenter</b> (born January 16, 1948) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, musician, editor and <a href="/wiki/Composer" title="Composer">composer</a>. Although Carpenter has worked with various film genres, he is associated most commonly with <a href="/wiki/Horror_film" title="Horror film">horror</a>, <a href="/wiki/Action_film" title="Action film">action</a> and <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_film" title="Science fiction film">science fiction films</a> of the 1970s and 1980s.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <p>Most films of Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of <i><a href="/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film)" title="Halloween (1978 film)">Halloween</a></i> (1978), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Fog" title="The Fog">The Fog</a></i> (1980), <i><a href="/wiki/Escape_from_New_York" title="Escape from New York">Escape from New York</a></i> (1981), and <i><a href="/wiki/Starman_(film)" title="Starman (film)">Starman</a></i> (1984). However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be considered as <a href="/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult classics</a>, and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. The cult classics that Carpenter has directed include the films <i><a href="/wiki/Dark_Star_(film)" title="Dark Star (film)">Dark Star</a></i> (1974), <i><a href="/wiki/Assault_on_Precinct_13_(1976_film)" title="Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)">Assault on Precinct 13</a></i> (1976), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film)" title="The Thing (1982 film)">The Thing</a></i> (1982), <i><a href="/wiki/Christine_(1983_film)" title="Christine (1983 film)">Christine</a></i> (1983), <i><a href="/wiki/Big_Trouble_in_Little_China" title="Big Trouble in Little China">Big Trouble in Little China</a></i> (1986), <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Darkness_(film)" title="Prince of Darkness (film)">Prince of Darkness</a></i> (1987), <i><a href="/wiki/They_Live" title="They Live">They Live</a></i> (1988) and <i><a href="/wiki/In_the_Mouth_of_Madness" title="In the Mouth of Madness">In the Mouth of Madness</a></i> (1995).</p>

He won a <a href="/wiki/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Music" title="Saturn Award for Best Music">Saturn Award for Best Music</a> for the film <i><a href="/wiki/Vampires_(film)" title="Vampires (film)">Vampires</a></i> (1998).

    <p>In a beginning film course at <a href="/wiki/USC_Cinema" class="mw-redirect" title="USC Cinema">USC Cinema</a> during 1969, Carpenter wrote and directed an 8-minute short film, <i><a href="/wiki/Captain_Voyeur" title="Captain Voyeur">Captain Voyeur</a></i>. The film was rediscovered in the USC archives during 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, <i><a href="/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film)" title="Halloween (1978 film)">Halloween</a></i> (1978).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
    <p>The next year he collaborated with producer <a href="/wiki/John_Longenecker" title="John Longenecker">John Longenecker</a> as co-writer, film editor and music composer for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Resurrection_of_Broncho_Billy" title="The Resurrection of Broncho Billy">The Resurrection of Broncho Billy</a></i> (1970), which won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

    <p>Carpenter's first major film as director, <i><a href="/wiki/Dark_Star_(film)" title="Dark Star (film)">Dark Star</a></i> (1974), was a science fiction comedy that he cowrote with <a href="/wiki/Dan_O%27Bannon" title="Dan O'Bannon">Dan O'Bannon</a> (who later went on to write <i><a href="/wiki/Alien_(film)" title="Alien (film)">Alien</a></i>, borrowing freely from much of <i>Dark Star</i>). The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> who hired him to work with the special effects for the film <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)" title="Star Wars (film)">Star Wars</a></i>). Carpenter's efforts did not go unnoticed as industry experts marveled at his ability to make low-budget films.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
    <p>Carpenter's next film was <i><a href="/wiki/Assault_on_Precinct_13_(1976_film)" title="Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)">Assault on Precinct 13</a></i> (1976), a low-budget thriller influenced by the films of <a href="/wiki/Howard_Hawks" title="Howard Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>, particularly <i><a href="/wiki/Rio_Bravo_(1959_film)" class="mw-redirect" title="Rio Bravo (1959 film)">Rio Bravo</a></i>. As with <i>Dark Star</i>, Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym "John T. Chance" (the name of <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>'s character in <i>Rio Bravo</i>). Carpenter has said that he considers <i>Assault on Precinct 13</i> to have been his first real film because it was the first film that he filmed on a schedule.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The film was the first time Carpenter worked with <a href="/wiki/Debra_Hill" title="Debra Hill">Debra Hill</a>, who played prominently in the making of some of Carpenter's most important films.</p>
